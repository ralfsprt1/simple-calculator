i don't think it can be any more simpler than that

it's a calculator that can do simple addition if you use v1

and more advanced calculations if you use v2 

also the v2 has a "self-crash" button

input numbers into the first input box

input numbers into the second input box

press "apreiķināt" to calculate using addition on v1

press "+", "-", "/", or "*" to calculate both numbers using any of the mentioned
